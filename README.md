The game is a first-person shooter set in a dynamic 3D environment where players must navigate around them in the space to find enemies. Players and enemies have health system displayed through on-screen UI elements. Enemies are spawned dynamically within a certain radius, with some moving toward the player and both get damaged when hit.
